The article is titled "Comparative efficacy and safety of a once-daily dosage of hypericum extract STW3-VI and citalopram in patients with moderate depression: a double-blind, randomised, multicentre, placebo-controlled study." It was published in Pharmacopsychiatry in 2006 by Gastpar.

The study examines treatments for depression. Specifically, it looks at moderate depressive disorder not otherwise specified. The treatments evaluated are Hypericum extract STW3-VI, Citalopram (Celexa), and placebo.

This was a phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted at multiple centers in Germany in 2002. There were 131 patients in the Hypericum group, 127 in the Citalopram group, and 130 in the placebo group.

Outcomes measured include efficacy outcomes like depression rating scores, response rates, and remission rates. Safety outcomes like compliance, toxicity, and adverse events were also assessed. The Hypericum and Citalopram groups showed significantly greater improvement compared to placebo on depression scores and response/remission rates. Hypericum had fewer side effects than Citalopram.

In summary, this well-designed clinical trial provides evidence that the herbal medication Hypericum extract and the antidepressant Citalopram are more effective than placebo for treatment of moderate depression. Hypericum had comparable efficacy to Citalopram but was better tolerated.

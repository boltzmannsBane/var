"Effectiveness of the Coping With Depression (CWD) course for older adults provided by the community-based mental health care system in the Netherlands: a randomized controlled field trial." is a study on depression treatment that was published in the International Psychogeriatrics journal in 2006 by Haringsma.

The study examines the Coping With Depression (CWD) course as a treatment for major depressive disorder in elderly adults. It compares the CWD course to watchful waiting.

This was a randomized clinical trial conducted at multiple community centers in the Netherlands. There were 52 patients in the CWD course group and 58 in the watchful waiting group.

Outcomes measured include depression severity scores, anxiety, mental well-being, physical well-being, pain, and quality of life domains like physical, social, and role functioning. The CWD course showed significantly greater improvement in depression scores compared to watchful waiting after treatment and at 1 year follow-up. The CWD course also showed some benefits across the other well-being and functioning outcomes.

In summary, this well-designed clinical trial provides evidence that the Coping With Depression psychoeducational course is more effective than watchful waiting for improving depressive symptoms in elderly patients with major depression. The CWD course also showed some broader benefits to quality of life and functioning.

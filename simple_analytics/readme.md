the purpose of this project is to create a simple piece of software with a GUI and a logic layer with a primary objective of experimentation with analytics collection

i also want to explore the current solutions for writing non-blocking HTTP applications in C, with potential multithreading

as bonus goals, i'd love to deploy this application on my homelab and set up a NoOps pipeline for it

stage 1: write a proper api with tests, perf profiling, validation, logs, etc

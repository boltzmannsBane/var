# Asynchronous I/O in C++

Asynchronous I/O allows programs to initiate I/O operations without waiting for them to complete, enabling concurrent execution of code. Various models, like stackful coroutines, stackless coroutines, and callback models, handle async I/O differently.

## 1. Stackful Coroutines

### Definition

- Maintain their own stack, preserving local variables and execution context across suspensions.

### Pros & Cons

- **Pros:** Can be suspended at virtually any point, preserving state.
- **Cons:** Higher overhead due to maintaining separate stacks.

### Managing Async I/O

- **Pausing:** Literally paused, preserving stack/context during async I/O.
- **Resuming:** Resumed right where paused once I/O is complete.

## 2. Stackless Coroutines

### Definition

- Do not have their own stack, utilizing the stack of the caller instead.

### Pros & Cons

- **Pros:** Lightweight, potentially more efficient.
- **Cons:** Can only be suspended at specific points.

### Managing Async I/O

- **Pausing:** State is stored in a heap-allocated structure during async I/O.
- **Resuming:** Resumes where it was paused, using the saved state.

## 3. Callback Model (e.g., `libevent`)

### Definition

- Utilizes callback functions to handle asynchronous events, without maintaining a separate stack.

### Event Handling

- Async events are managed by registering callbacks to be executed upon event completion.

### "Pausing" and "Resuming"

- **Pausing:** Inherent to the async non-blocking nature.
- **Resuming:** Callbacks handle event completion, effectively managing "resumption" of control.

### Comparison

- Coroutines allow asynchronous code to be written in a more synchronous style, simplifying state and flow control.
- Callbacks offer a more fragmented control flow and can present challenges in state management across async operations.

## Notes

- Both stackful and stackless coroutines offer mechanisms for "pausing" and "resuming" during async operations but manage this in different ways and with different trade-offs.
- The callback model doesnâ€™t "pause" or "resume" in the same way but inherently allows other code to run during async operations through its event-driven nature.
- The choice between these models often depends on specific use cases, requirements, and personal or team familiarity and preference.
